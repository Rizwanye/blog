Before the widespread adoption of ai/ml tech, these types of machines were treated as unicorns or buzzwords.
However, we have seen how effective/efficient these technologies can be utilised in surveillance and intelligence gathering.
Adopting this tech into L.A.W.S and U.A.V.S, as a result can yield significant decision making considerations.

Another significant benefit of AI/Ml is in its use in streamlining training and decision making process. This is extremely useful 
in cases where time is of the essence such as recuiting, and many more others that I will not dwelve indepthly. 

With such weight being put into these system. The question being is... how do we know if these machines are making the right or ethical decisions given this context?
One field that has been popuarily rising is XAI, also known as explainable artifical intelligence.
