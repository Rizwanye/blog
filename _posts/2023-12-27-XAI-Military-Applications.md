Before the widespread adoption of ai/ml tech, these types of machines were treated as unicorns or buzzwords.
However, we have seen how effective/efficient these technologies can be utilised in surveillance and intelligence gathering.
Adopting this tech into LAWS, as a result can yield significant decision making considerations.

As a result, the question being, how do we know if these machines are making the right or ethical decisions given this context?
One field that has been popuarily rising is XAI, also known as explainable artifical intelligence.
