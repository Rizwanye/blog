From the beginning of 2020 to today (2023), technology, as we have witnessed, has been exponentially fast-tracked towards a new era. We have observed the development of digital ID, coupled with a global push towards AI/ML and smart machines.
And has far exceeded the projection of many analysts growth projection.

Previously, these types of terms were merely buzzwords thrown around to entice non-technological end users. 
However, the actual curation and real-world use cases of digital ID, language models, and crypto technology can now demonstrate their benefits to society and have a real world use case. 

Previously people hyptohesised that there will be a new Industrial revolution called "Industry 4.0".
I believe we are at that stage now, or at the beginning of it and I have a very strong conviction that the new industry 4.0 will happen in our lifetimes.

What exactly is 4.0? 

The term **"Industry 4.0"** refers to the fourth industrial revolution, a new phase in the evolution of industry that is characterized by the integration of digital technologies, data-driven processes, and automation into various aspects of manufacturing and other industries. The concept of **Industry 4.0** builds on the previous three industrial revolutions:

1. **Industry 1.0 (Late 18th century):** Mechanization using water and steam power.
  
2. **Industry 2.0 (Early 20th century):** Mass production through the use of electricity and assembly lines.

3. **Industry 3.0 (Late 20th century):** Automation and the use of electronics and computers in manufacturing.

**Industry 4.0** represents a significant shift towards the intelligent, interconnected, and automated use of technologies such as the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **machine learning (ML)**, **big data**, **cloud computing**, and other emerging technologies. This new phase aims to create "smart factories" where machines and systems communicate with each other, make decisions, and optimize processes in real time.

Key characteristics of **Industry 4.0** include:

1. **Interconnectivity:** Machines, devices, sensors, and people are connected to each other through the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

2. **Information Transparency:** Data is collected and shared across the entire production process, providing real-time insights and enabling better decision-making.

3. **Technical Assistance:** Systems can assist and support humans in making decisions and solving problems. This involves technologies like **AI**, **machine learning**, and advanced analytics.

4. **Decentralized Decision-Making:** The ability of systems to make decisions autonomously, reducing the need for human intervention in routine tasks.

5. **Smart Factories:** The use of cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing process, creating highly flexible and efficient production systems.

Given this information, the question remains. 
Will you accept or oppose the new industry 4.0 and beyond?
