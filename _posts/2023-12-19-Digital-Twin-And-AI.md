When we think of AI, most people visualise either something physical like a robot or some type of visual projection of an entity. 
Much of the physical development regarding robotics are behind compared to our current AI/ML development. 

A field that has not been widely discussed in the field of AI. Is digital twins.

Digital twins as defined by IBM is "A digital twin is the digital representation of a physical asset. It uses real-world data (both real time and historical) combined with engineering, simulation or machine learning (ML) models to enhance operations and support human decision-making."

Thus it is the metaphysical represetnation of a physical object.

When we currently develop AI/ML nowdays, it is run via primarily code, such as python, using ML packages. 

But the question is, how do we
