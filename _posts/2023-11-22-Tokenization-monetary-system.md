The new monteary system will change everything that we know of and how we understand the economy through the use of RWA (Real world assset) tokenization.
Where assets will be represented using tokens. As such this centeralises control, data and tokenization of depoists, stocks, derivates and etc.

As a result there will be a new paradigm and new way of life bounded by a whole new set of rules. Much like how when we had the pandemic which has dramatically
shifted our pereception of the current reality and the economy. The tokenization of the world economy will be something we have never witnessed before.

There are already global intiative lunched by big banks, and technology firms developing this technology. It is without a doubt tokenization of RWA is taken seriously.
Most likely after a prelimiary phase, there will be a global shift towards this new paradigm.
