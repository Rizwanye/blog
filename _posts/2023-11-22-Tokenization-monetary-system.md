The new monteary system will change everything that we know of and how we understand the economy through the use of RWA (Real world assset) tokenization.
Where assets will be represented using tokens. For example tokenization of depoists, stocks, derivates and etc. Where assets are stored on a centralised database.
Unlike cryptocurrency where it is decentralsied. The current development of tokenization by big banks and higher entities are focusing on a hybrid of crypto-tech, defi with a unique blend of centralisation, control and monitization. 

As a result there will be a new paradigm and new way of life bounded by a whole new set of rules. Much like how when we had the pandemic which has dramatically
shifted our pereception of the current reality and the economy. The tokenization of the world economy will be something we have never witnessed before.

There are already global intiative lunched by big banks, and technology firms developing this technology. It is without a doubt tokenization of RWA is taken seriously.
Most likely after a prelimiary phase, there will be a global shift towards this new paradigm.

Based on this, I strongly believe we will see some type of dramatic change by 2030. 

If there is a tokenziation of our global economy, it will mean a massive shift in job change. 
Jobs such as manual book keeping, taxes, auditing and etc will be mostly changed. 

With a globally tokenized economy, many aspects of what we see in todays life will not be the same.
As most assets will be tokenized, there will be much much more efficent data transfer as data is standardised and stored centrally, rather than spreadsheets
and legacy systems. Furthermore there will be much more effective deployment of Ml/AI machines used to predict many aspects of transactions and our daily lives. 
It is thus, the beginning of the new industrial revolution. 

**Some Possibilities of Tokenization Include:**

**Globalization:**
Tokenization could facilitate cross-border transactions with fewer obstacles and reduced transaction costs. A global marketplace for various assets becomes more feasible.

**Escrow Services:**
Smart contracts can be used to create **escrow services** where funds are held until certain conditions are met. For instance, in a real estate transaction, funds may be held in **escrow** until the buyer completes the inspection and approves the property.

**Supply Chain Management:**
Conditional payments can be programmed to release funds when certain milestones in a **supply chain** are achieved. For example, payment to a supplier may be automatically triggered upon successful delivery of goods.

**Insurance Payouts:**
Smart contracts can automate **insurance payouts** based on predefined conditions. For instance, an insurance policy for flight delays could automatically trigger a payout if a flight is delayed beyond a specified time.

**Loan Repayments:**
Conditional payments can be used in **loan agreements**, automatically deducting payments from a borrower's account when due. If predefined conditions like missed payments are met, penalties or adjustments may be applied automatically.

**Event-Triggered Payments:**
Payments can be triggered by external events. For example, an **insurance payout** could be automatically initiated upon the occurrence of a specified event, such as a natural disaster.

**Tokenized Rewards Programs:**
Conditional payments can be utilized in **tokenized reward programs**. Tokens may be automatically distributed to users when they achieve certain milestones or meet specific criteria.

**Smart Incentive Structures:**
Organizations can use smart contracts to create **incentive structures** for employees or partners. Conditional payments can be released when performance goals are met, fostering motivation and accountability.

Furthermore, with the implementation of a **global Digital ID** from the G20 summit in 2023, individuals' identities will be tokenized, which may have a record of your education to your name, job performance, etc.

The possibilities are endless with this new technology; it is therefore only up to the human imagination to see the possibilities of the integration of the RWA and **tokenization**.

However, the implemnentation of a monetary system backed using tokenziation would be difficult without public trust. 
Furthermore the co-existence of tokenization and fiat currecny can be an issue as shown through several pilot studies. 

With many special interests looking into RWA and tokenization. One may ask what will they do next? Or how will they imeplement the new change?
One may worry thinking about this.
